Disclaimer: ChatGPT-5 may still produce hallucinations.  You may encounter minor bugs, errors, flawed and inconsistecies.  However, the big picture of the program still work which demostrates the impressive capabilities of AI in code generation.  

Purpose: This repository aims to illustrate how ChatGPT generate code and its coding quality, not produce a fully bug-free program.  It should not be treated as a production-ready program.
